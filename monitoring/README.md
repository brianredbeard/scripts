## Monitoring Utilities

These are scripts to simplify working with Rackspace Cloud monitoring.  They are
useful for doing common complex operations so that you don't need to know the
`entity_id`, `check_id`, `alarm_id`, etc for resources.

### Installing

These scripts require the use of the `rackspace-monitoring` and
`rackspace-monitoring-cli` python packages which can be installed via `pip`.
